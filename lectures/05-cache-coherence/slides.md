---

## Review of Cache Memory Basics
- **Purpose**: Bridge the processor-memory speed gap
- **Principle**: Temporal and spatial locality
- **Organization**: Sets, ways, blocks/lines
- **Mapping**: Direct mapped, set associative, fully associative
- **Operations**: Read/write hits and misses

---

## Cache Memory Hierarchy
- **L1 Cache**: Smallest, fastest, closest to processor
- **L2 Cache**: Larger, slightly slower, shared or private
- **L3 Cache**: Largest on-chip cache, typically shared
- **Inclusive vs. Exclusive Hierarchies**
- **Impact on Coherence**: Multiple levels complicate coherence

---

## Shared Memory Multiprocessors
- **Definition**: Multiple processors accessing common memory space
- **Organization**:
  - Centralized shared memory (UMA)
  - Distributed shared memory (NUMA)
- **Challenges**: Memory contention, coherence, consistency

---

## Shared Memory Access Patterns
- **Read-only data**: No coherence issues
- **Migratory data**: Moves between processors
- **Producer-consumer data**: One writes, others read
- **Read-write shared data**: Multiple writers, most challenging
- **Privately accessed data**: Dynamic assignment to processors

---

## The Cache Coherence Problem
- Example scenario:
  - Processor P1 reads value X from memory into its cache
  - Processor P2 reads value X from memory into its cache
  - P1 updates X to X' in its cache
  - P2 reads X (still has old value)
  - **Inconsistency**: P2 doesn't see P1's update

![Timeline showing coherence problem](images/coherence_problem.svg)

---

## Cache Coherence Problem - Detailed Example
- Initial state: Memory location X contains value 0
- P1 reads X (P1 cache: X=0)
- P2 reads X (P2 cache: X=0)
- P1 writes X=1 (P1 cache: X=1)
- P1 writes to memory (Memory: X=1)
- P2 reads X again (P2 cache still has X=0) ‚Üê STALE DATA!
- P2 never sees the update unless coherence is maintained

---

## Cache Coherence Conditions
1. **Write Propagation**: Updates to data in one cache must be propagated to other caches
2. **Transaction Serialization**: All processors must observe memory operations in a consistent order
3. **Write Serialization**: All writes to the same memory location must be seen in the same order by all processors

---

## Cache Coherence Conditions - Write Propagation
- **Definition**: Changes to data in one cache must eventually be visible to other caches
- **Implementation mechanisms**:
  - Update-based: Write updates sent to all copies
  - Invalidation-based: Other copies invalidated upon write
- **Tradeoffs**: Traffic vs. latency

---

## Cache Coherence Conditions - Transaction Serialization
- **Definition**: All processors must observe a consistent global order of operations
- **Challenge**: Different processors may observe operations in different orders
- **Requirement**: Coherence protocol must enforce a serialized view
- **Example**: If P1 writes X then Y, other processors might see Y update before X

---

## Cache Coherence Conditions - Write Serialization
- **Definition**: All writes to the same location must be seen in the same order by all processors
- **Problem**: Without write serialization, different processors may observe different final values
- **Solution**: Coherence protocol ensures all processors agree on the sequence of writes

---

## Coherence vs. Consistency
- **Cache Coherence**: Ensures visibility of memory updates
- **Memory Consistency**: Defines the order of memory operations
- Coherence addresses the "what" of memory updates
- Consistency addresses the "when" of memory updates
- Both are required for correct parallel execution

![Coherence vs consistency diagram](images/coherence_vs_consistency.svg)

---

## Coherence vs. Consistency - Detailed Example
- **Program example**:
  ```
  Initially: X=0, Y=0
  Processor 1: X=1; Y=1;
  Processor 2: while(Y==0){}; r1=X;
  ```
- **Coherence guarantees**: Eventually P2 will see X=1 and Y=1
- **Consistency determines**: Whether P2 can read Y=1 but still see X=0 temporarily
- **Outcome depends on both**: Coherence ensures updates are visible, consistency determines when

---

## Basic Approaches to Cache Coherence
- **Snooping-based protocols**: Broadcast-based, suitable for bus-based systems
- **Directory-based protocols**: Scalable for larger systems
- **Software-based approaches**: Explicit coherence management in software
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining hardware and software techniques

![Taxonomy of coherence approaches](images/coherence_approaches.svg)

---

## Hardware vs. Software Coherence
- **Hardware coherence**:
  - Transparent to programmer
  - Lower latency
  - Higher hardware complexity
- **Software coherence**:
  - Programmer/compiler managed
  - Lower hardware cost
  - Potentially higher performance overhead
  - Used in specific domains (e.g., some GPUs)

---

## Update vs. Invalidation Protocols
- **Update protocols**:
  - Broadcast updates to all copies
  - Advantages: Reduces miss latency for subsequent reads
  - Disadvantages: Higher bandwidth consumption
- **Invalidation protocols**:
  - Invalidate all other copies on write
  - Advantages: Less traffic for multiple writes
  - Disadvantages: Read misses after invalidation
- Modern systems predominantly use invalidation protocols

---

## Snooping-Based Coherence - Principles
- **Fundamental mechanism**: All caches "snoop" on a shared bus
- **Broadcasting**: Coherence messages sent to all processors
- **Bus arbitration**: Serializes access requests
- **Implementation**: Cache controllers observe all bus transactions
- **Advantage**: Simple implementation
- **Disadvantage**: Limited scalability due to bus bandwidth

---

## Snooping-Based Coherence - Operation
- **Bus transactions**: Read, ReadX (read exclusive), Invalidate, WriteBk (write back)
- **Snooping process**:
  1. Cache controller issues bus transaction
  2. All cache controllers observe the transaction
  3. Each controller takes appropriate action based on local state
- **Example**: On ReadX, other caches invalidate their copies

---

## Snooping Protocol Challenges
- **Bus bandwidth limitations**: Becomes bottleneck with many processors
- **Arbitration overhead**: Increases with processor count
- **Energy consumption**: Broadcasting is power-intensive
- **Snoop filter optimizations**: Reduce unnecessary snooping
- **Typical scale limit**: ~16-32 cores before performance degradation

---

## Directory-Based Coherence - Principles
- **Fundamental mechanism**: Central directory tracks cache line sharing status
- **Targeted messages**: Coherence messages sent only to relevant processors
- **Scalability**: Supports larger numbers of processors
- **Components**: Directory controller, coherence controllers at each node
- **Directory entry fields**: Presence bits, state information, owner identification

---

## Directory-Based Coherence - Operation
- **Basic operations**:
  1. Request sent to directory
  2. Directory consults sharing records
  3. Directory forwards request to relevant nodes
  4. Nodes respond to requester or directory
- **Advantage**: Scales to many processors
- **Disadvantage**: Higher latency for coherence operations

---

## Directory Organization
- **Full-map directories**: One bit per processor per block
- **Limited directories**: Track a limited number of sharers
- **Sparse directories**: Only track cached blocks
- **Hierarchical directories**: Multi-level tracking
- **Tradeoffs**: Memory overhead vs. precision

---

## Cache Coherence Protocol Classifications
- **State-based**: Cache block states determine actions
- **Ownership-based**: Tracks who owns write permission
- **Invalidation vs. Update**: How writes are propagated
- **Blocking vs. Non-blocking**: Protocol handling of concurrent requests
- **Silent vs. Non-silent**: Whether clean evictions are reported

---

## Cache Coherence Protocol Models
- **State transition system**:
  - States for each cache block
  - Events that trigger transitions
  - Actions taken during transitions
- **Finite state machines (FSMs)**:
  - Formal way to represent protocols
  - Enables verification and analysis

---

## Cache States - Basic Concepts
- **Valid/Invalid**: Whether data can be used
- **Clean/Dirty**: Whether data matches memory
- **Exclusive/Shared**: Whether others have copies
- **Owned**: Responsibility for providing data to others
- **Different protocols use different combinations of these concepts**

---

## Basic MSI Protocol
- Three states:
  - **Modified (M)**: Cache has the only valid copy, dirty
  - **Shared (S)**: Cache has a valid copy, clean, others may have copies
  - **Invalid (I)**: Cache does not have a valid copy
- Simplest coherence protocol that works correctly
- Foundation for more complex protocols

![MSI state diagram](images/msi_state_diagram.svg)

---

## MSI Protocol - State Transitions
- **I‚ÜíS**: Read miss, no other cache has copy
- **I‚ÜíM**: Write miss
- **S‚ÜíM**: Write hit, invalidate other copies
- **M‚ÜíS**: Another processor reads the block
- **M‚ÜíI**: Another processor writes to the block
- **S‚ÜíI**: Another processor writes to the block

---

## MSI Protocol - Detailed Operation (1)
- **Cache Read Miss, Block Invalid (I)**:
  1. Send Read request on bus
  2. If another cache has M, it provides data and moves to S
  3. Memory provides data if no cache has M
  4. Requesting cache moves to S

---

## MSI Protocol - Detailed Operation (2)
- **Cache Write Miss, Block Invalid (I)**:
  1. Send ReadX (read exclusive) request on bus
  2. If another cache has M, it provides data and moves to I
  3. All other caches with S move to I
  4. Requesting cache moves to M

---

## MSI Protocol - Detailed Operation (3)
- **Cache Write Hit, Block Shared (S)**:
  1. Send Invalidate on bus
  2. All other caches with S move to I
  3. Requesting cache moves to M
- **Cache Write Hit, Block Modified (M)**:
  1. No bus transaction needed
  2. Write directly to cache

---

## MSI Protocol - Example Scenario
- **Initial state**: Memory X=0, all caches have X in I state
- **Sequence**:
  1. P1 reads X: P1:S(0), Memory X=0
  2. P2 reads X: P1:S(0), P2:S(0), Memory X=0
  3. P1 writes X=1: P1:M(1), P2:I, Memory X=0
  4. P2 reads X: P1:S(1), P2:S(1), Memory X=1
- **Note**: Memory updated when M transitions to S

---

## MSI Protocol - Strengths and Weaknesses
- **Strengths**:
  - Simple implementation
  - Correctly maintains coherence
  - Works for both snooping and directory protocols
- **Weaknesses**:
  - Extra bus transactions for read-to-write transitions
  - No distinction between exclusive clean and shared clean
  - Write-back on all replacements of M state blocks

---

## MESI Protocol - Overview
- Adds an **Exclusive (E)** state to MSI
- **Exclusive**: Block is only in one cache, is clean (matches memory)
- Optimization to reduce bus traffic
- Allows direct transition to M without bus invalidation if already in E
- Common in commercial processors (Intel Core series, AMD Zen architecture)

![MESI protocol overview](images/mesi_state_diagram.svg)

---

## MESI Protocol - State Transitions
- **I‚ÜíE**: Read miss, no other cache has copy
- **I‚ÜíS**: Read miss, other cache(s) have copy
- **I‚ÜíM**: Write miss
- **E‚ÜíM**: Write hit (silent transition, no bus traffic)
- **E‚ÜíS**: Another processor reads the block
- **E‚ÜíI**: Another processor writes to the block
- **Plus all MSI transitions**

---

## MESI Protocol - Benefits
- **Reduced write-invalidate traffic**: E‚ÜíM requires no bus transaction
- **Cleaner eviction**: E state blocks can be silently evicted (no write-back)
- **Performance impact**: Can reduce bus traffic by 30-40% over MSI

---

## MESI Protocol - Example Scenario

- **Sequence**:
  1. P1 reads X (no other copies): P1:E(0), Memory X=0
  2. P1 writes X=1: P1:M(1), Memory X=0 (No bus transaction!)
  3. P2 reads X: P1:S(1), P2:S(1), Memory X=1
  4. P3 writes X=2: P1:I, P2:I, P3:M(2), Memory X=1

---

## MOESI Protocol - Overview

- Allows sharing of modified data without writing back to memory
- Reduces memory traffic for shared writable data
- Common in AMD processors (Zen architecture family)
- Critical for performance in multi-socket AMD EPYC servers

![MOESI protocol state diagram](images/moesi_state_diagram.svg)

---

## MOESI Protocol - State Transitions
- **M‚ÜíO**: Another processor reads a modified block
- **O‚ÜíM**: Write hit on an owned block
- **O‚ÜíI**: Another processor takes exclusive ownership
- **O‚ÜíS**: Memory updated, responsibility released
- **Plus all MESI transitions**

---

- **Hardware overhead**: Additional state bits and control logic

---

## MOESI Protocol - Example Scenario
- **Initial state**: Memory X=0, all caches have X in I state
- **Sequence**:
  1. P1 reads X: P1:E(0), Memory X=0
  2. P1 writes X=1: P1:M(1), Memory X=0
  3. P2 reads X: P1:O(1), P2:S(1), Memory X=0 (Memory not updated!)
  4. P3 reads X: P1:O(1), P2:S(1), P3:S(1), Memory X=0
  5. P1 evicts block: P2:S(1), P3:S(1), Memory X=1 (Now memory updated)

---

## Other Protocol Variants

- **Firefly Protocol**: Early directory protocol
- **Customized variants**: Many systems implement proprietary variations

---

## MESIF Protocol (Intel)

- Only one cache can be in F state for a block
- Reduces cache-to-cache transfer latency
- Eliminates duplicate responses
- Used in Intel QuickPath Interconnect and UltraPath Interconnect

---

## Protocol Comparison - State Space
- **MSI**: Minimal functional protocol (3 states)
- **MESI**: Adds optimization for exclusive reads (4 states)
- **MOESI**: Adds optimization for shared dirty data (5 states)
- **MESIF**: Alternative to MOESI, optimizes for multiple readers (5 states)
- **Tradeoff**: More states = better performance but higher complexity

---

## Protocol Comparison - Performance
| Protocol | Write After Read | Read After Write | RMW Operations | Memory Traffic |
|----------|------------------|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| MSI      | High             | Medium           | High           | High          |
| MESI     | Medium           | Medium           | Medium         | Medium        |
| MOESI    | Medium           | Low              | Medium         | Low           |
| MESIF    | Medium           | Medium           | Medium         | Medium        |

- **Example**: 64-processor system with full-map requires 64 bits per block

---

## Inclusive vs. Non-Inclusive Caches
- **Inclusive caches**:

- **Outer level coherence**: Between clusters or sockets
- **Filtering approaches**: Reduce outer level traffic
- **Examples**: Intel mesh interconnect, AMD Infinity Fabric

---

## False Sharing
- Multiple processors access different variables in the same cache line
- Cache coherence operates at cache line granularity
- Results in unnecessary invalidations and transfers
- Example:
  - Array[0] accessed by P1, Array[1] accessed by P2
  - Both in same cache line ‚Üí ping-pong effect
- Can significantly degrade performance
- Real measurements show up to 10x slowdown in extreme cases
